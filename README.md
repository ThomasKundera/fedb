Flat Earth Debunking

Flatters are strange, some are very irrational and there's no way 
we can see to make them think rationally.

But many are just naive, or came there by mistake and get into it. 
Without a minimum culture in science, they can be fooled.
Which means they can also be helped.

I lost too much time in empty debates where I answered by dry and harsh
sentences to usual flatters memes and derpiness.
Maybe time to do better.

I'm thinking since quite some time about a real resource center
for argumentation, mixing serious stuff (as a core reference),
with good vulgarization texts, memes and video.

I dunno how and where to setup that. I already have a few stuff,
mostly TeX, Povray and the like, I could open a git repository
somewhere and people who are interested could contribute.

But we would also need a wiki, a YouTube channel and maybe more.
Who is (at least a bit) interested by that?
Just spelling fix and stuff can be help.

Anyone interested?

TK.
