Beware of python2/3 and Qt4/5

Running urlextrac.sh will get fresh urls from firefox history.
./urlextrac.sh

Not lazy: download again all html files, and full retrive (not only the 200 lasts)
However database is not updated with new entry: only read.
./ytc.py --write-res --dont-be-lazy --full
This command will likely takes hours to proceed.
