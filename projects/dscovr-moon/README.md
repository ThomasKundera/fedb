# Analysing DSCOVR vtime-lapse of the Moon in 2015

## Introduction

On July 2015 the EPIC camera mounted on DSCOVR probe orbiting at L1 Sun-Earth point took a series of images of the Moon passing in front of the Earth. This recorded event was published as a time-lapse by NASA shortly after: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/from-a-million-miles-away-nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth/
This short sequence was a subject of wonder by many, and of disbelief by some, who pretended that such a view was impossible for various reasons.
Our goal is to see if those reasons holds by an in-deep analysis of the available data.

The main reasons I saw were:
1. Apparent size of the Earth or Moon to be incorect in regard to the location of the EPIC camera
2. Greenish band on the right of the Moon
3. Flattening of part of the Moon in one of the frame
4. Apparent motionless coulds on Eartth during the event.
11. Earth axis is misrepresented.
12. As it's summer, North Pole should be visible.
3. Moon is too dark
4. Flattening of part of the Moon in one of the frame
5. Apparent motionless coulds on Eartth during the event.

## Analysis

### Precise time and date of the event


### Apparent size and could motion

To address this point we'll just simulate the actual view of the Moon using available parameters and if possible legit cloud maps from that date and time.



## Conclusion


## Data sources, etc.

### Dates
