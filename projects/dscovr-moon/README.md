# Analysing DSCOVR vtime-lapse of the Moon in 2015

## Introduction

On July 2015 the EPIC camera mounted on DSCOVR probe orbiting at L1 Sun-Earth point took a series of images of the Moon passing in front of the Earth. This recorded event was published as a time-lapse by NASA shortly after: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/from-a-million-miles-away-nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth/
This short sequence was a subject of wonder by many, and of disbelief by some, who pretended that such a view was impossible for various reasons.
Our goal is to see if those reasons holds by an in-deep analysis of the available data.

The main reasons I saw were:
- Apparent size of the Earth or Moon to be incorect in regard to the location of the EPIC camera
- Greenish band on the right of the Moon
- Flattening of part of the Moon in one of the frame
- Apparent motionless coulds on Eartth during the event.
