* Position, velocity and acceleration

{ Opening animation or intro }

+ Introduction

Before addressing physics of actual object moves, we have to introduce mathematical concepts and notions that will be useful to understand those actual observations.

I'll avoid to be too formal, but if you are interested, an introduction to vector space would be useful.

Here, I'll just illustrate basic notions often using implicit intuitive notions that may be approximate but I hope not too much misleading.

+ Positions and coordinates

Lets first work only on a one dimension object (in our reality it could be a railroad); a straight line for now.

On that line we can label points. And we can chose a point that we'll consider as origin, that is the point that will be the coordinate (0).

Then we can chose another point that we define as being an unit away from origin.

With that origin and that unit vector, we can give a coordinate to any point on that continuous line.

This allow to follow a point moving on that line, that is a point changing coordinates as time is passing.

If we call x(t) the position of the point at a given time t, we defined a function that gives the location of the point between a chosen interval of time.

As we are doing Newtonian physics, we have to postulate:
- time always flow forward and is uniform for all considered space locations
- the trajectory of points is always a continuous line, points cannot jump instantaneously from a location to another, or backward in time.

Those postulates seem intuitively valid, we won't go beyond for now.

As we may need more dimensions later, lets introduce a second dimension (for example, on a football field), then we need two coordinates to describe the position of an object.

As our Universe has three dimensions of space, we usually need three space coordinates to reference a single point.

Although a frame of reference is an abstract mathematical concept, in practice it must be anchored to some real object or set of objects. Without a reference point, there is no way to attach anything in empty space.

It's important to note that the position of an object is relative to the frame of reference we are using. If we change the frame of reference, the position of the object will also change.

This concept of position being relative to a frame of reference is a key idea in mechanics, and it will be important as we continue to explore the concepts of speed and acceleration.
