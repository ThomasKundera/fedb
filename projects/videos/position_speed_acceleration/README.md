* Position, speed and acceleration

+ Introduction

Before adressing real-life example, we have to introduce mathematical concepts and notions that will be useful to understand those actual observations.

I'll avoid to be too formal, but if you are interested, an introduction to vector space would be useful.

Here, I'll just illustrate basic notions often using implicit intuitive notions that may be approximative but I hope not too much misleading.

+ Positions and coordinates

Lets first work only on a one dimension object; a straight line for now.

On that line we can label points. And we can chose a point that we'll consider as origin, that is the point that will be the coordinate (0).

Then we can chose another point that we define as being an unit away from origin.

With that origin and that unit vector, we can give a coordinate to any point on that continuous line.

This allow to follow a point moving on that line, that is a point changing coordinates as time is passing.

If we call x(t) the position of the point at a given time t, we defined a function that gives the location of the point between a chosen intervale of time.

As we are doing Newtonian physics, we have to postulate:
- time always flow forward and is uniform for all considered space locations
- the trajectory of points is always a cotiunous line, poinst cannot jump instantaneouslyf rom a locatyion to another, or backward in time.

Those postulates seems intuitively valid, we won't go beyond for now.
