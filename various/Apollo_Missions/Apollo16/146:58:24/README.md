# Astronaut standing up

## Generalities
On video https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16v.1465824.mpg (context: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a16/a16.sta8.html ) at about 00:08, astronaut John Young stand up easily from his knees, which looks usual from naive eyes.

Lets see how it was performed.

## Data about the camera
Focal length if possible, but more important, frame rate for the dynamic analysis.

## Defining actual positions
This means actually understanding where the astronaut was and how he actually moved.

### Data about the intrinsic properties of objects in the scene
Length, width and depth of all relevant elements have to be gathered here (mass data if possible even if not to be used yet).

### Relative positions of objects evolution during the sequence
Properly locating all relevant objects relative position on all relevant video frames.

## Static analysis
Simple static analysis on a few relevant frames to see relevant forces and equilibrium.

## Dynamic analysis
Full dynamic analysis of the scence, likely to be performed in a 3D rigid body simulator.
