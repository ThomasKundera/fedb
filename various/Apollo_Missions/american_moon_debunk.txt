Shadows are not parallel 2:49:00

This section demonstrates how arguments can be manipulated to tell a false story. Here, the producer uses the fact that one pictures does not show parallel shadows and appears to converge to a point just left of the screen. The implication here is that there was a spotlight causing the shadows to appear not to be parallel. The argument, they claim, that similar photos on Earth show shadows that are not parallel, is not valid because the shadows in the picture converge to the same point. They then dismiss the MythBusters episode where they reproduced the NASA photo exactly, by using sloping ground and a spotlight because, their argument is, that using a spotlight, and not the sun, simply confirms that an artificial light was used for the NASA photo. The producer states this is a major blunder. The only blunder is how much of a joke this documentary is.

Most of this segment is having his photographic buddies look at this one picture. There are dozens of pictures of shadows in the Apollo library and only one has shadows that converge to one point. Picking one photo, that by circumstance, has converging shadows is not evidence. It is selection bias. Especially when you consider that, depending on how you line up the shadows, they don't necessarily meet at the same point. There is a large degree of variability that can be applied to the tracing. The MythBusters, far from demonstrating a blunder, prove the exact point the producer was trying to make. That you can simulate shadows converging to a point by the slope of the ground. The fact that a spotlight was used is irrelevant because the spotlight was many meters away from the scene, and the shadows converged at a point metres in front of the spotlight. Furthermore, the producer claims that the shadows in the Apollo picture cannot be explained because the terrain looks flat. However, the terrain in the MythBusters picture has sloping terrain that looks flat. The flatness is an illusion in the Apollo picture as much as it is in the MythBusters picture.

The fact that there is one picture where shadows converge is a coincidence, as can be proven by the existence of only one such photo, and confirmation that you can simulate the same picture by adjusting the terrain on Earth. The fact that a spotlight was used is irrelevant, as the spotlight was in a different position to where the shadows converged. What was proven in the experiment is that shadows, that do not converge to the point of the light source is can be reproduced by sloping the ground, and that the ground nevertheless can look flat.

Backlight 3:00:00

The producer attempts to dismiss the backlighting phenomenon by going at lengths about luminosity and what happens on Earth. They dismiss the MythBusters episode by implying that the white shirt from one of the presenters is a possible reason for the extra light in the experiment, and I agree with this. However, there is this persistent attempt to dismiss the reflective properties of the moon’s surface by using observations from Earth. They even quote a NASA report that was written before anyone was on the moon that confirms the lunar surface is a poor reflector and one would expect that there would be no illumination in shadow areas. This begs the question which is deliberately avoided. Why would NASA use reflectors and such to illuminate parts of the set, when they themselves believed the lunar surface is a poor reflector? 

Nobody expected illumination of shadow areas given the reflectivity of the moon’s surface being 10-12% (not 8% as explained in the documentary). If we could show that this backlight phenomenon is a real phenomenon, then this confirms the moon landing pictures as genuine since NASA would have gone out of their way to avoid introducing extra light sources if it was a hoax. The case is settled by the Chinese lander and rover called Rabbit. The rover drove off the Chinese lander, turned around leaving wet looking tyre tracks on the lunar surface, and took a picture of the lander. What it demonstrated was that the areas behind the sun shadow area of the lander were lit up like a Christmas tree. In other words, areas which should have been completely dark according to the producer where bathed in light. These pictures were taken in 2014, 3 years before the documentary was made, meaning he did not include the most conclusive, independent evidence possible – pictures from an independent space agency that show the exact same phenomenon as what was observed during the first moonwalk. In fact, China is hardly a friendly nation to the US and would have no reason to doctor or fake images to be consistent with the Apollo pictures. 

The deception does not just stop there. They reference the NVIDIA experiment in which they deliberately misquote the results of the experiment by  asserting NVIDIA found the extra cause of reflective light causing Buzz to light up was Neil Armstrong’s white suite. The producer claims that the amount of light reflected by Neil would not be sufficient to light up the area to the degree seen in the picture. That is correct. However, that was not the main finding of the NVIDIA computer simulation.  NVIDIA demonstrated that by modelling the reflective properties of the moon dust with 10-12% reflectivity, the reflective light alone was enough to light up Buzz. Neil just increased this effect slightly. The purpose of the Neil observation was to identify an unknown bright source of light that hoaxers claimed was a studio reflector. NVIDIA, by simulating the position of the astronauts, identified the bright area to be Neil’s suit, and not some unknown studio reflector. The reflectivity of Neil’s suit added a little bit extra lighting to complete the backlight effect. Why did the documentary not explain this? The reason is obvious. He had no way of explaining the NVIDIA simulation demonstrating that the lunar surface reflection could light up Buzz. Instead he focused on the second, less significant part of the simulation.

The reflective lighting from the moon, confirmed by the Chinese lander pictures in 2014, is the reason there is blurring of the shadows behind the astronauts. The blurring is the result of the extra illumination coming at different angles.

== Conclusion ==

I have now debunked every single argument from this documentary, except the last about the press conference in which the Apollo astronauts, exhibiting stage fright, are presumed guilty of the ultimate deception because they were not high fiving each other and dancing several weeks after the moon landing which included weeks in quarantine. The producer deliberately fails to show the pictures when the astronauts were picked up after splashdown showing them practically doing just that – exactly the situation you would expect them to be smiling and ecstatic. All I will add to this is the case of Amanda Knox, an American tourist who was found guilty of murder, and then released after the real killer was identified. Amanda was in Italy, and what made the Italian lead detective convinced she was guilty? The way Amanda reacted after she found out her room mate was murdered was unusual. There are other cases just like this where we convince ourselves someone is guilty because we ‘think’ we know how we would react.
